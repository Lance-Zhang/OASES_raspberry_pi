there are two kinds of trajectory tracking waypoint methods.

1. time prior
The points in trajectory are updated and given in a high frequency. The USV always tracks the latest point without considering the error to the last point.

2. accuracy prior
The trajectory points are updated and given in a low frequency. Before seeking the next point, the USV must track the current given point within a given accuracy.
